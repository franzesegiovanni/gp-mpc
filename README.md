See the original code at [locuslab/mpc.pytorch](http://locuslab.github.io/mpc.pytorch)

The original code was used as a baseline to build the code in this repository.
The goal of this repository is to study the effect of learned dynamics with Gaussian Process (but not only) on the performance of the MPC controller.
